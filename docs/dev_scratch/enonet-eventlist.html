    This was basically a JS fiddle. Played with it before deciding if I wanted to use EONET as my use-case.
    Output was entirely console. You'll see I did a basic bounding box for current locations, but
    that doesn't always yield much, so that may not (likely will not) be in the final app.

<script type="module">
    async function fetchEvents(bbox) {
        //swap the fetchPath declarations below to find out just how chill your neck of the woods has been for the last 5 days!
        const fetchPath = 'https://eonet.gsfc.nasa.gov/api/v3/events'
        // const fetchUrl = `${fetchPath}?status=open&limit=20&days=150&bbox=${bbox.join(',')}`;
        const fetchUrl = `${fetchPath}?status=open&limit=20&days=5`;
        console.log(fetchUrl)
        const response = await fetch(fetchUrl);
        if(response.ok) {
            console.log((await response.json()).events);
        }
    }

    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', async function() {
        //added on dom content loaded b/c was going to render
        //some html, at which point I decided research phase was done enough.
        let bbox = []
        const boxSize = 1
        if(navigator.geolocation) {
            navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((position) => {
                const {latitude, longitude} = position.coords
                console.log(position.coords.latitude, position.coords.longitude);

                const minLon = longitude - boxSize
                const maxLat = latitude + boxSize

                const maxLon = longitude + boxSize
                const minLat = latitude - boxSize
                bbox = [minLon, maxLat, maxLon, minLat]
